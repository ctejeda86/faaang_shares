# faaang_shares
We get a dataframe with the stock performance of companies listed in NYSE and Nasdaq, from 2 differents dataframe, and then subset FAANG to chart the stock performance.
I'm a new R user, but I want to share with people who is interested in R simply codes that are easy to reproduce and have instructions about what does the code does.
